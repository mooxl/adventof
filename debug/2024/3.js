/*
Upon approaching a snowy hill, the Yeti discovers a playful snowball contest about
to begin. To light the lantern and start the game, sorting a pile of snowballs
by size using some code is necessary. However, running the code results in the
snowballs getting mixed up instead of neatly ordered â€” the sorting function
isn't working as expected, and a quick fix is needed to keep the fun going!
